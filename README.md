These codes correspond to Paper :Repetitive transient impact detection and its application in cross-machine bearing fault detection, which is currently under review. The code supports training and testing using our processed dataset, as well as the visualization of convolutional kernels and processed samples. For now, we will upload the processed dataset. Once the paper is accepted, we will supplement our proposed nonlinear processing methods.
Before running, you need to download the data first. Here is the link to the data on the cloud driveï¼š[processed_data](). After that, modify the data path option in the main script's argument parser, and then simply run the main function to train the model.
